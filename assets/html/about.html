    <h2>What is Criminal Justice Reform?</h2>
    <p>
      Through litigation and campaigning, criminal justice reformers are attempting
      to reduce the number of people in jail. The nation can rectify wrongs before
      they get worse by fighting for nationwide reform at various levels of government. 
      To ensure that this principle is honored, inmates' human rights are preserved, 
      and their chances for social reintegration are improved, prison reform is required.

      <p>
        Over 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United 
        States.10,000 youth are detained or incarcerated in adult jails and prisons. Studies show that 
        youth held in adult facilities are 36 times more likely to commit suicide and are at the greatest 
        risk of sexual victimization. Youth of color are over-represented in the ranks of juveniles being 
        referred to adult court.

      <h3>Wrongful Conviction</h3>
      <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/000000/disapprove.png"/>
      <p>
        Wrongful convictions data reveal that the percentage of wrongful convictions is anywhere between
        2% and 10%, according to the National Registry of Exonerations' annual report for 2019. That
        translates to 46,000 to 230,000 people imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. Since 1989, over
        2400 people have been exonerated in the United States. In 40 cases (31%), the witness' identification
        was incorrect. Furthermore, 81 people made false confessions, bringing the total number of false confessions 
        to 62 percent, with 17 percent of them including informants.

      <h3>Mass Incarceration</h3>
      <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/100/000000/crowd.png"/>
      <p>
        Despite making up close to 5% of the global population, the U.S. has more than 20% of the world’s prison population. 
        Since 1970, our incarcerated population has increased by 500% ­­–  
        2 million people in jail and prison today, outpacing population growth and crime.

      <h3>Excessive Punishment</h3>
      <img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-glyph-geotatah/100/000000/external-abuse-toxic-behavior-glyph-glyph-geotatah.png"/>
      <p>
        Incarceration is a permanent punishment for many Americans. Even after they’re released from prison, parole conditions require formerly incarcerated people to pay restitution, supervision fees, and other costs. 
        Loss of employment and housing, threatened immigration status, and disqualification from welfare benefits, student loans, and certain licenses often condemn formerly incarcerated people and their families to lifelong poverty.

      <p>
          Overcrowding, violence, sexual abuse, and other conditions pose grave risks to prisoner health and safety. 
          Mistreatment of prisoners based on race, sex, gender identity, or disability remains extremely common in prison.

      <p>
        An estimated 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the
        United States.

            <p>The School-to-Prison Pipeline refers to the practice of directing students away from school and 
            into the criminal justice system.The juvenile and criminal justice systems funnel youth out of public schools. 
            Many of these young people are Black or Brown, have disabilities, or have experienced poverty, abuse, or neglect 
            in the past, and would benefit from more care and services. They are instead isolated, punished, and expelled. 
            While cops in schools result in children being charged with crimes for behavior that should be dealt with within 
            the school, Students of color are particularly exposed to expulsion patterns and biased discipline.</p>

            <h1>Wrongly Convicted</h1>
            <p>In today's world, there are more innocent individuals in jails and prisons than ever before. Exonerations are 
            becoming more common, revealing a flawed criminal justice system. Injustice convictions have harmed the integrity 
            of our system and devastated the lives of innocent men and women due to a lack of accountability for police and 
            prosecutors, reliance on junk science and misled eyewitnesses, and the indigent defense issue.</p>

            <h1>Prison Reform</h1>
            <p>Our criminal justice system does not prepare people in jail to succeed when they return to society. People 
            with a criminal record have a hard time finding work, renting an apartment, or even getting a driver's license. 
            These restrictions are so strict that many people become trapped in a cycle of incarceration. In fact, after being 
            released from prison, offenders encounter so many obstacles that more than 75% return to prison. Then there's the 
            financial cost to taxpayers. Every year, we spend billions on this broken system.</p>
