            <p>The School-to-Prison Pipeline refers to the practice of directing students away from school and 
            into the criminal justice system.The juvenile and criminal justice systems funnel youth out of public schools. 
            Many of these young people are Black or Brown, have disabilities, or have experienced poverty, abuse, or neglect 
            in the past, and would benefit from more care and services. They are instead isolated, punished, and expelled. 
            While cops in schools result in children being charged with crimes for behavior that should be dealt with within 
            the school, Students of color are particularly exposed to expulsion patterns and biased discipline.</p>

            <h1>Wrongly Convicted</h1>
            <p>In today's world, there are more innocent individuals in jails and prisons than ever before. Exonerations are 
            becoming more common, revealing a flawed criminal justice system. Injustice convictions have harmed the integrity 
            of our system and devastated the lives of innocent men and women due to a lack of accountability for police and 
            prosecutors, reliance on junk science and misled eyewitnesses, and the indigent defense issue.</p>

            <h1>Prison Reform</h1>
            <p>Our criminal justice system does not prepare people in jail to succeed when they return to society. People 
            with a criminal record have a hard time finding work, renting an apartment, or even getting a driver's license. 
            These restrictions are so strict that many people become trapped in a cycle of incarceration. In fact, after being 
            released from prison, offenders encounter so many obstacles that more than 75% return to prison. Then there's the 
            financial cost to taxpayers. Every year, we spend billions on this broken system.</p>
