            <h1>What is criminal Justice Reform?</h1>
            <p>Criminal justice reform focuses on structural
            concerns in the criminal justice system, such as racial profiling,
            police brutality, over-criminalization, mass imprisonment, and recidivism.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="indexA2">
        <p>Through litigation and campaigning, criminal justice reformers are attempting
            to reduce the number of people in jail. The nation can rectify wrongs before
            they get worse by fighting for nationwide reform at various levels of government. 
            To ensure that this principle is honored, inmates' human rights are preserved, 
            and their chances for social reintegration are improved, prison reform is required.</p>

        <p>Over 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United 
            States.10,000 youth are detained or incarcerated in adult jails and prisons. Studies show that 
            youth held in adult facilities are 36 times more likely to commit suicide and are at the greatest 
            risk of sexual victimization. Youth of color are over-represented in the ranks of juveniles being 
            referred to adult court.</p>
