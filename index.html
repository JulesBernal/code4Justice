            <h1>What is criminal Justice Reform?</h1>
            <p>Criminal justice reform focuses on structural
            concerns in the criminal justice system, such as racial profiling,
            police brutality, over-criminalization, mass imprisonment, and recidivism.</p>
            
            <p>Through litigation and campaigning, criminal justice reformers are attempting
            to reduce the number of people in jail. The nation can rectify wrongs before
            they get worse by fighting for nationwide reform at various levels of government. 
            To ensure that this principle is honored, inmates' human rights are preserved, 
            and their chances for social reintegration are improved, prison reform is required.</p>

            <h1>Issues</h1>
            <h2>The School-to-Prison Pipeline</h2>
            <p>Over 250,000 youth are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as adults every year across the United 
            States.10,000 youth are detained or incarcerated in adult jails and prisons. Studies show that 
            youth held in adult facilities are 36 times more likely to commit suicide and are at the greatest 
            risk of sexual victimization. Youth of color are over-represented in the ranks of juveniles being 
            referred to adult court.</p>
            <img class="indexImg" src="assets/youthJuvenileGraph.png" alt="Image of a graph with a Title of Rate Per Youth residing 
            in Juvenile Dentention, Correctional, and or Residential Facilities by Race in the United States in 2017.
            American Indian at 235, Asian at 19, Black at 383, Hispanic at 118, other not number, total at 138, and white at 83.">
            <h2>Wrongly Convicted</h2>
            <p>Wrongful convictions data reveal that the percentage of wrongful convictions is anywhere between
            2% and 10%, according to the National Registry of Exonerations' annual report for 2019. That
            translates to 46,000 to 230,000 people imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. Since 1989, over
            2400 people have been exonerated in the United States. In 40 cases (31%), the witness' identification
            was incorrect. Furthermore, 81 people made false confessions, bringing the total number of false confessions 
            to 62 percent, with 17 percent of them including informants.</p>
            <h2>Prison Reform</h2>
            <p>Over 600,000 people are released from state and federal prisons each year, while over 11 million people pass through 
            local jails. Furthermore, one out of every three adults in the United States has a criminal record, mostly for minor, 
            non-violent acts and sometimes for crimes committed decades ago. Even if they have paid their debt to society, turned their 
            lives around, and demonstrated that they are unlikely to re-offend, the long-term and sometimes lifetime impact of a criminal 
            record will prevent many of these people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education,loans, and credit.</p>
